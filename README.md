This Python script efficiently fetches and analyzes energy data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). Utilizing the \texttt{entsoe} Python package, it seamlessly interfaces with the ENTSO-E API to gather various types of energy data including day-ahead prices, load, generation, installed generation capacity, and hydro storage data.

\section*{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dynamic Data Querying}: Capable of fetching data for multiple European countries with specified time ranges.
  \item \textbf{Robust Error Handling}: Each data type query is encapsulated in individual \texttt{try-except} blocks, ensuring continuous operation even in the event of partial failures.
  \item \textbf{Data Storage}: Efficiently stores fetched data into structured CSV files for each country and data type, facilitating easy access and further analysis.
  \item \textbf{Modular Code Design}: The code is structured for readability and easy maintenance, with a clear separation between the data fetching logic and the main execution flow.
  \item \textbf{Scalability}: Easily scalable to include more countries or different types of energy data from the ENTSO-E API.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Usage:}
The script is designed to be user-friendly. Users can specify the desired country codes and date ranges, and the script will handle the rest, fetching and storing the relevant data.

This tool is ideal for researchers, data analysts, and enthusiasts in the field of energy data analysis, providing a streamlined and reliable way to access and analyze European energy market data.
